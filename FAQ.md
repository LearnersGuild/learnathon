#### What do we do if there's an odd number of Players?

To ensure that every Player gets an equal pairing experience, use the following tactics in order of priority:

1. Rotate in a Debugger or Facilitator to pair with an odd Player out
1. Create one group of 3 for each session (rotating so that no Player is in a group of 3 twice)
1. Have one person solo in each session
