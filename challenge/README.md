# Make a Word

In this challenge, you'll build a word-guessing game like Scrabble or Boggle.

The idea for this game is simple: players have to make words out of a set of letters shown on the screen.

There are only two rules:

- Words must use only the letters shown in the set
- Words must be real dictionary words

For example, if the letters shown are `N A I P L R A`, then the following words are _correct_: `PLAN`, `AIR`, `RAIN`.

The following words are _incorrect_: `APE` (`E` is not one of the provided letters) and `NARL` (not a word).

**Your task is to build a working version of this game with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.**
