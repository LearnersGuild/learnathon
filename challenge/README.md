# Make a Word

In this challenge, you'll build a word-guessing game like Scrabble or Boggle.

The idea for this game is simple: players have to make words out of a set of letters shown on the screen.

There are only two rules:

- Words must use only the letters shown in the set
- Words must be real dictionary words

For example, if the letters shown are `N A I P L R A`, then the following words are _correct_: `PLAN`, `AIR`, `RAIN`.

The following words are _incorrect_: `APE` (`E` is not one of the provided letters) and `NARL` (not a word).

**Your task is to build a working version of this game with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.**

## Getting Started

1. Fork this gist
1. Open your fork in JS Bin
1. Start working on the first objective

## Challenge Objectives

Complete each of the challenge objectives in order.

### 1: Complete the Logic in checkGuess()

Review the existing code in `index.html`, `main.css`, and `script.js`.

The incomplete logic in the `checkGuess()` function needs to be finished in order for the basic version of this game to work.

**GOOD NEWS!** This step has already been completed for you. The developer who solved it even recorded [this video for you to watch](TODO: need link) so you can get up-to-speed.

As you watch the video, note things like:

- How they go about learning about the existing code
- What steps they go through to solve the problem
- How they debug their code

### 2: Make a "Random" Feature

### 3: Improve User Interface

### 4: Make a "Shuffle" Feature

### 5: Make the Number of Letters Adjustable

### 6: Get Creative
