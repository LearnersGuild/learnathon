# Learnathon

Welcome to the Learners Guild Learnathon!

The Learnathon is a game to practice collective learning through a series of pair programming sessions on a set challenge.

## Preparing to Play

Before you can start playing, you'll need two things:

- A GitHub account (sign up at [https://github.com/join](https://github.com/join))
- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (go through the [Pre-Game Tutorials](#pre-game-tutorials))

## How to Play

The game consists of many [pairing sessions](#the-pairing-session). To play the game, work with your pair to learn as much as you can using the challenge provided.

At the end of each pairing session, pairs give feedback to each other on a set of [essential skills](#essential-skills).

Your goal is to integrate the feedback you receive and improve your scores over the course of your pairing sessions! The more you are able to improve, the better your overall score.

You need these materials:

1. A **pair** (another player to work with)
1. A **feedback log** (place to record feedback)
1. A **challenge** (coding problem to work on together)

Your facilitator will help you find a **pair** and provide you with a link to the **feedback log** as well as to your **challenge**.

_You can find an example challenge in [this gist][example-challenge-gist]. This will be similar to what you will encounter during the actual game. Make sure to read the instructions thoroughly._

Once you have these materials, you are ready to start your first pairing session. After you complete a pairing session, choose another pair and start again! (The game is _recursive_ ;).

## Winning the Game

There is no single winner of the game. After the game is over, Learners Guild will review the data collected and determine who to invite to Round 2 of Enrollment.

There are only a limited number of spots available, so not everyone will get in.

For the Learnathon, we look most closely at the following criteria (in order of preference):

1. Skill improvement from feedback received
1. Quality of feedback given
1. Quality of work produced

Therefore, if you want to do well at the game, focus on those things. Improve your skills by requesting and integrating feedback. Give kind, actionable, and specific feedback to others. And collaborate with your pair to produce the best work you can.

## Rules

This is a _collaborative_ game, not a competitive game. You will do better if you focus on giving, receiving, and integrating good feedback.

If you follow these rules, you will do well in the game. If you break these rules, you will be kicked out of the game.

1. Be honest. A good learning environment requires truth.
1. Be kind and respectful. Learning is a vulnerable act, so go easy on yourself and others.
1. Be willing to play. Follow curiosity with your pair.
1. Give good feedback. Use the [giving good feedback](#giving-good-feedback) suggestion if you aren't sure what good feedback looks like.

OK, so we won't kick you out for not being playful. But you'll definitely have a lot more fun.

## The Pairing Session

A pairing session is two people working on the same problem together. You can think of it like group problem solving.

Stages of a pairing session:

1. Check-in
1. Designate a driver and navigator
1. Practice the challenge
1. Log feedback
1. Wrap up

### 1. Check-in

As soon as you sit down with your pair, start with a check-in.

Say hi to your pair! Introduce yourself, and share whatever you want to share with them that will help you be present and ready to work together.

If you're willing, now is a good time to also share which skills you are aiming to improve so that your pair can give you specific feedback. Help your pair help you.

Give them time to do the same.

### 2. Designate a driver and navigator

With your pair, determine who will be _driving_ (using the keyboard to write code), and who will be _navigating_ (helping the driver think about the problem and come up with a solution).

You will switch roles halfway through the session, so you will get a chance to be both driver and navigator.

### 3. Practice the challenge

Once you've designated a driver and navigator, you're ready to begin working on the challenge.

Open the challenge provided and follow the instructions. Decide with your pair which objective you want to work on.

Get as far as you can in the time allotted, and don't worry about completing the _entire_ challenge. It is designed to be _challenging_, after all.

### 4. Log feedback

After practice time is over, stop working on the challenge and take a few minutes to log feedback and submit your code. Follow the instructions in the challenge for how to submit your code.

Each pair should log feedback on their own computer.

First, log feedback for _yourself_. Consider how you fared during that session, and submit a feedback log.

Second, log feedback for _your pair_. Consider their performance, and pay special attention to any skills that they specifically mentioned they wanted to improve.

The pair feedback is confidentialâ€”the feedback you give them will be anonymized and bundled up with other feedback after you submit it.

**However**, it is highly recommended that you ask your pair to share some or all of their feedback for you verbally, especially on the skills you want to improve.

_If you don't ask for verbal feedback from your pair, you will not know your feedback scores until after the game is over._

#### Giving good feedback

If your pair asks you to share feedback, it is important to be kind and respectful when doing so. Here is a good formula to use when giving feedback:

- Share one thing they did well
- Share one thing they can improve on
- Offer a suggestion for how they can improve

It is also important to give feedback on _behavior_, not _character_. Saying "One thing you did well is that you have nice hair." is not as useful/actionable as "One thing you did well was ask clarifying questions when you didn't fully understand what I said."

### 5. Wrap up

Thank your pair for working with you, shake hands or give them a high five, and move on to your next pairing session!

### Pre-Game Tutorials

Before starting the Game, you should have 40-50 hours of programming experience. If you don't know where to begin, we recommend the following tutorials:

- Complete "Make a Website", "Make an Interactive Website", and "Learn the Command Line", "Learn SQL", and "JavaScript" tracks on [Codecademy][codecademy-tutorials]
- Complete free Git courses on [Code School][code-school]
