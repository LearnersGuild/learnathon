# Learnathon

Welcome to the Learners Guild Learnathon!

The Learnathon is a game to practice collective learning by working on a set challenge over the course of multiple sessions.

**How much can _you_ learn?**

## Preparing to Play

Before you can start playing, you'll need two things:

- A GitHub account (sign up at [https://github.com/join](https://github.com/join))
- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (go through the [Pre-Game Tutorials](#pre-game-tutorials))

## How to Play

**Your goal** is to complete the challenge as best you can, and to learn as much from your peers so that you can improve your skills over the course of the game. The more you are able to improve, the better your overall score.

You need these materials:

1. A **challenge** (coding problem to work on)
1. A **feedback log** (place to record feedback)

Your facilitator will provide you with a link to a **feedback log** as well as to your **challenge**.

Once you have these materials, you are ready to start Stage 1 (see below).

_Note: this [example challenge][example-challenge-gist] is similar to what you will encounter during the actual game. We highly recommend trying your hand at it before coming to the game. Make sure to read the instructions thoroughly._

### Stages

There are 3 stages:

1. **First Attempt**
2. **Pair Learning**
3. **Re-Attempt**

In the **First Attempt**, you'll attempt to solve a coding challenge on your own. You probably won't finish it, but that's OK—you're not supposed to finish it.

During the **Pair Learning** stage, you'll work with other learners on the same challenge in a series of [pairing sessions](#the-pairing-session). This is an opportunity to share skills and knowledge, and to get valuable feedback from your pair.

Finally, in the **Re-Attempt** stage, you'll work on your own on the same challenge. This time, you'll start _from scratch_ to see how much further you can get than in the First Attempt.

## Winning the Game

There is no single winner of the game. After the game is over, Learners Guild will review the data collected and determine who to invite to Round 2 of Enrollment.

We look at the following metrics:

1. How much you can learn (by improving your challenge solutions)
1. How much you can help others learn (by helping your pair improve their solution)

### How to _Really_ Win the Game

_All that being said_, the Learnathon is best played if you consider it as an opportunity for rich, fun learning. It is as much for _you_ to evaluate _us_.

How well do we nurture a collective learning environment? Is the work fun? Do you get to learn? Consider these and other questions as you go through the day.

If you treat the Learnathon as a opportunity to indulge in curiosity with other motivated learners, we believe you'll have a great time.

Therefore, if you want to do well at the game, focus on those things. Improve your skills by requesting and integrating feedback. Give kind, actionable, and specific feedback to others. And collaborate with your pair to produce the best work you can.

## Rules

This is a _collaborative_ game, not a competitive game. You will do better if you focus on giving and receiving help with your peers.

If you follow these rules, you will do well in the game. If you break these rules, you will be kicked out of the game.

1. Be honest. A good learning environment requires truth.
1. Be kind and respectful. Learning is a vulnerable act, so go easy on yourself and others.
1. Be willing to play. Follow curiosity with your pair.
1. Give good feedback. Use the [giving good feedback](#giving-good-feedback) suggestion if you aren't sure what good feedback looks like.

OK, so we won't kick you out for not being playful. But you'll definitely have a lot more fun.

## The Pairing Session

A pairing session is two people working on the same problem together. You can think of it like group problem solving.

At the end of each pairing session, pairs give feedback to each other on a set of [essential skills](#essential-skills).

Stages of a pairing session:

1. Check-in
1. Designate a driver and navigator
1. Practice the challenge
1. Log feedback
1. Wrap up

### 1. Check-in

As soon as you sit down with your pair, start with a check-in.

Say hi to your pair! Introduce yourself, and share whatever you want to share with them that will help you be present and ready to work together.

If you're willing, now is a good time to also share which skills you are aiming to improve so that your pair can give you specific feedback. Help your pair help you.

Give them time to do the same.

### 2. Designate a driver and navigator

With your pair, determine who will be _driving_ (using the keyboard to write code), and who will be _navigating_ (helping the driver think about the problem and come up with a solution).

You will switch roles halfway through the session, so you will get a chance to be both driver and navigator.

### 3. Practice the challenge

Once you've designated a driver and navigator, you're ready to begin working on the challenge.

Open the challenge provided and follow the instructions. Decide with your pair which objective you want to work on.

Get as far as you can in the time allotted, and don't worry about completing the _entire_ challenge. It is designed to be _challenging_, after all.

### 4. Log feedback

After practice time is over, stop working on the challenge and take a few minutes to log feedback and submit your code. Follow the instructions in the challenge for how to submit your code.

Each pair should log feedback on their own computer.

First, log feedback for _yourself_. Consider how you fared during that session, and submit a feedback log.

Second, log feedback for _your pair_. Consider their performance, and pay special attention to any skills that they specifically mentioned they wanted to improve.

The pair feedback is confidential—the feedback you give them will be anonymized and bundled up with other feedback after you submit it.

**However**, it is highly recommended that you ask your pair to share some or all of their feedback for you verbally, especially on the skills you want to improve.

_If you don't ask for verbal feedback from your pair, you will not know your feedback scores until after the game is over._

#### Giving good feedback

If your pair asks you to share feedback, it is important to be kind and respectful when doing so. Here is a good formula to use when giving feedback:

- Share one thing they did well
- Share one thing they can improve on
- Offer a suggestion for how they can improve

It is also important to give feedback on _behavior_, not _character_. Saying "One thing you did well is that you have nice hair." is not as useful/actionable as "One thing you did well was ask clarifying questions when you didn't fully understand what I said."

### 5. Wrap up

Thank your pair for working with you, shake hands or give them a high five, and move on to your next pairing session!
