# Enrollment Game

Welcome to the Learners Guild Enrollment Game!

The Enrollment Game is a chance to practice collective learning by working on a set challenge over the course of multiple sessions.

**How much can _you_ learn?**

---

## Pre-Requirements

Before you can start the Enrollment Game, you'll need three things:

1. A [GitHub account](https://github.com/join)
2. Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
3. A desire to learn

It is _strongly recommended_ that you also do the [Example Challenge][example-challenge-gist].

If you're fuzzy on HTML/CSS and JavaScript, we recommend that you complete the [Prep Tutorials](#prep-tutorials).

## How to Engage

**Your goal** is to complete the challenge as best you can, and to collaborate with your team to learn and improve together. The more you improve your challenge and help your team, the better your overall score.

You need these materials:

1. A [challenge](#challenge) (coding problem to work on)
1. A [feedback log](#feedback-log) (place to record feedback)

Your facilitator will provide you with a link to both.

Once you have these materials, you are ready to start Stage 1 (see below).

_Note: this [example challenge][example-challenge-gist] is similar to what you will encounter during the actual Enrollment Game. We highly recommend trying your hand at it before attending. Make sure to read the instructions thoroughly._

### Stages

There are 3 stages:

1. [Team Learning](#team-learning)
2. [Technical Quiz](#technical-quiz)
3. [Retrospective](#retrospective)

During the **Team Learning** stage, you'll work with a team of other learners on a coding challenge. This is an opportunity to share skills and knowledge with your team, and to collectively come up with interesting approaches and solutions. This is very similar to the daily experience of a learner at Learners Guild.

In the **Technical Quiz** stage, you'll complete a quiz on your own. This quiz will cover skills like computational thinking and problem solving, and will test your knowledge of core web development topics like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This is very similar to a technical interview or evaluation that you'd encounter when applying for a web development job.

Finally, the **Retrospective** is a time to reflect on your learning, give feedback to your team, and share insights. The first part of the Retrospective is a solo exercise, and then we'll gather as a group.

### Selection for Enrollment

There is no single winner of the Enrollment Game. After collecting the data from all of our Enrollment Games, Learners Guild will review the outcomes and select whom to invite to our upcoming cohorts.

We look at the following metrics:

1. How much you can learn
1. How well you work in a team
1. Your technical aptitude and knowledge

#### How to _Really_ Do Well

_All that being said_, the Enrollment Game works best if you consider it as an opportunity for rich, fun learning. It is as much for _you_ to evaluate _us_.

How well do we nurture a collective learning environment? Is the work fun? Do you get to learn? Consider these and other questions as you go through the day.

If you treat the Enrollment Game as a opportunity to indulge in curiosity with other motivated learners, we believe you'll have a great time.

Therefore, if you want to do well, focus on those things. Improve your skills by asking questions and exploring possible answers with your team. Share your knowledge and support your team.

### Rules

This is a _collaborative_ activity, not a competitive one. You will do better if you focus on giving and receiving help with your peers.

If you follow these rules, you will do well.

1. **Be honest.** A good learning environment requires truth.
1. **Be kind.** Learning is a vulnerable act, so go easy on yourself and others.
1. **Be respectful.** This should be obvious. Don't be a jerk.
1. **Be willing to play.** Follow curiosity with your pair.
1. **Practice keyboard consent.** Never touch someone else's computer without their explicit permission.
1. **Give [good feedback](#what-is-good-feedback)**. Feedback powers the engines of learning.

OK, so we won't kick you out for not being playful. But you'll definitely have a lot more fun.

## Team Learning

During team learning, you'll work with a team to solve and improve the challenge. You can think of it like group problem solving.

Stages of a team learning session (repeat as needed):

1. Share and sync up
1. Design together
1. Implement in pairs
1. Review

### 1. Share and sync up

Since you and the rest of your team are likely at different stages in the challenge, the first step is to share your knowledge and sync up your solutions.

The purpose of syncing up is to build on the collective knowledge and ideas of the team. Each member likely had unique and interesting approaches to the challenge that other members could benefit from.

With your team, share and discuss your solutions. Highlight interesting approaches, and look for the ways in which your solutions are similar and different.

### 2. Design together

Once the team has sync'ed up, it is ready to start moving forward on the challenge (i.e. start the next objective).

Before beginning to actually _write code_, it's always a good idea to spend some time thinking about the problem and designing a solution.

With your team, discuss different ways to solve the next objective. Consider things like:

- What data will you need? Where will it come from?
- What kinds of functions will you need to write, and what will they do?
- What are the inputs and outputs of each function?
- What is the flow of events? How will users interact with the program, and how will the program respond?

Once you've spent some time (5-15 minutes, usually) discussing a design, break into pairs to work on writing code.

### 3. Implement in pairs

Once you've designed an approach, you're ready to implement the solution with a pair. With your pair, implement the design your team has come up with as best you can.

You should both write code on your own computers, but agree upon what to write. Related question: [How do I "build together"?](#how-do-i-build-together)

If you need help or run into problems you can't figure out, ask your team! That's what they're there for.

### 4. Review

Once you finish implementing with your pair, review your work together.

Is the code clean? Is it well formatted? Did you test it for any bugs?

Once you've reviewed, get back together with your team and start over with a new "Share and sync up".

## Technical Quiz

After co-learning with your team, you are now ready to test your new skills and knowledge by taking a technical quiz.

The **Technical Quiz** is a solo session (i.e. you work on your own).

It is meant to ensure that you have the requisite skills and knowledge to join and contribute to the learning collective. In this way, it is similar to a technical evaluation stage in any web development job interview.

## Retrospective

At the end of the game, take some time to reflect on your learning. Log reflections for yourself and give feedback to your team using the [feedback log](#feedback-log).

The logged feedback is **confidential and anonymous**â€”the feedback you give them will be anonymized and bundled up with other feedback after you submit it.

_Fin_

That's it! You've completed the Enrollment Game!

Time to celebrate. Give yourself a high five. Do a little dance. Run a victory lap. Whatever. You decide.

## Resources

### Challenge

When you start the Enrollment Game, your facilitator will provide a link to the challenge used.

In the meantime, you can work on the [example challenge][example-challenge-gist]. It's similar to what you will encounter during the actual Enrollment Game.

### Feedback Log

When you start the Enrollment Game, your facilitator will provide a link to the Feedback Log.

You'll be asked to give _yourself_ feedback (i.e. reflect on your learning), in addition to feedback on each of your teammates and your team lead.

### Prep Tutorials

Before starting the Enrollment Game, you should have 50+ hours of programming experience. If you don't know where to begin, we recommend the following tutorials:

- Complete "Make a Website", "Make an Interactive Website", and "Learn the Command Line", "Learn SQL", and "JavaScript" tracks on [Codecademy][codecademy-tutorials]
- Go through the HTML & CSS course on [Shay Howe's site][shay-howe]
- Complete free Git courses on [Code School][code-school]

## Frequently Asked Questions

#### How do I "build together"?

If you've never worked on a coding problem with another person before, it can be a little awkward. That's ok! There's no one, right way to pair.

That being said, here are some useful techniques that you can use to make pairing fun and effective:

- Talk through the _procedure_ and _logic_ of your program with your pair before writing code.
- Work separately for 5 minutes, then share and compare for 2 minutes.
- Divide and conquer: split up the problem, each work on separate parts, and then share your solutions.

Regardless of which techniques you use, at the very least you should rely on your pair for help and ask them for help when you get stuck. Be generous with your knowledge!

#### What is good feedback?

It is important to be kind and respectful when giving feedback. Here is a good formula to use when giving feedback:

- Share one thing they did well
- Share one thing they can improve on
- Offer a suggestion for how they can improve

It is also important to give feedback on _behavior_, not _character_. Saying "What you did well is that you were nice." is not as useful/actionable as "One thing you did well was ask clarifying questions when you didn't fully understand what I said."
