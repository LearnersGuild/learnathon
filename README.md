# Learnathon

Welcome to the Learners Guild Learnathon!

This is a game to practice collective learning through a series of pair  programming sessions on a set challenge.

At the end of each session, pairs give feedback to each other on a set of Essential Skills.

Your goal is to integrate the feedback you receive and improve your scores over the course of your pairing sessions! The more you are able to improve, the better your overall score.
