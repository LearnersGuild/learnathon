# Enrollment Game

Welcome to the Learners Guild Enrollment Game!

The Enrollment Game is a chance to practice collective learning by working on a set challenge over the course of multiple sessions.

**How much can _you_ learn?**

---

## Pre-Requirements

Before you can start the Enrollment Game, you'll need three things:

1. A [GitHub account](https://github.com/join)
2. Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
3. A desire to learn

It is _strongly recommended_ that you also do the [Example Challenge][example-challenge-gist].

If you're fuzzy on HTML/CSS and JavaScript, we recommend that you complete the [Prep Tutorials](#prep-tutorials).

## How to Engage

**Your goal** is to complete the challenge as best you can, and to collaborate with your team to learn and improve together. The more you improve your challenge and help your team, the better your overall score.

You need these materials:

1. A [challenge](#challenge) (coding problem to work on)
1. A [feedback log](#feedback-log) (place to record feedback)

Your facilitator will provide you with a link to both.

Once you have these materials, you are ready to start Stage 1 (see below).

_Note: this [example challenge][example-challenge-gist] is similar to what you will encounter during the actual Enrollment Game. We highly recommend trying your hand at it before attending. Make sure to read the instructions thoroughly._

### Stages

There are 3 stages:

1. [First Attempt](#first-attempt)
2. [Team Learning](#team-learning)
3. [Final Attempt](#final-attempt)

In the **First Attempt**, you'll attempt to solve a coding challenge on your own. You probably won't finish it, but that's OK—you're not supposed to finish it in this stage.

During the **Team Learning** stage, you'll work with a team of other learners on the same challenge. This is an opportunity to share skills and knowledge with your team, and to collectively come up with interesting approaches and solutions.

Finally, in the **Final Attempt** stage, you'll work on your own on the same challenge. This time, you'll start _from scratch_ to see how much further you can get than in the First Attempt.

### Selection for Enrollment

There is no single winner of the Enrollment Game. After collecting the data from all of our Enrollment Games, Learners Guild will review the outcomes and select whom to invite to our upcoming cohorts.

We look at the following metrics:

1. How much you can learn
1. How well you work in a team

#### How to _Really_ Do Well

_All that being said_, the Enrollment Game works best if you consider it as an opportunity for rich, fun learning. It is as much for _you_ to evaluate _us_.

How well do we nurture a collective learning environment? Is the work fun? Do you get to learn? Consider these and other questions as you go through the day.

If you treat the Enrollment Game as a opportunity to indulge in curiosity with other motivated learners, we believe you'll have a great time.

Therefore, if you want to do well, focus on those things. Improve your skills by asking questions and exploring possible answers with your team. Share your knowledge and support your team.

### Rules

This is a _collaborative_ activity, not a competitive one. You will do better if you focus on giving and receiving help with your peers.

If you follow these rules, you will do well.

1. **Be honest.** A good learning environment requires truth.
1. **Be kind.** Learning is a vulnerable act, so go easy on yourself and others.
1. **Be respectful.** This should be obvious. Don't be a jerk.
1. **Be willing to play.** Follow curiosity with your pair.
1. **Practice keyboard consent.** Never touch someone else's computer without their explicit permission.
1. **Give [good feedback](#what-is-good-feedback)**. Feedback powers the engines of learning.

OK, so we won't kick you out for not being playful. But you'll definitely have a lot more fun.

## First Attempt

The first stage is a solo session (i.e. you work on your own).

During this stage, you will attempt to solve the objectives in the [challenge](#challenge) on your own. After working on the challenge, save your gist and submit your solution with the [submission form](#submission-form)

You won't have time to complete the whole challenge. The goal is simply to get as far as you can. In the next stage, you'll continue improving on your attempt.

## Team Learning

During pair learning, you'll work with a peer on the same challenge. You can think of it like group problem solving.

At the end of each pairing session, you'll give feedback to your pair.

Stages of a pairing session:

1. Check-in
1. Sync up
1. Build together
1. Log feedback
1. Share feedback
1. Wrap up

### 1. Check-in

As soon as you sit down with your pair, start with a check-in.

Say hi to your pair! Introduce yourself, and share which skills you are aiming to improve so that your pair can give you the most useful feedback. Help your pair help you.

Give them time to do the same.

### 2. Sync up

Since you and your pair are likely at different stages in the challenge, the first step is to sync up.

Syncing up will mean different things depending on the relative states of each person.

If one person has completed more objectives than the other, the farther-along person should help their pair get caught up.

This doesn't mean _solving the problem for them_, but rather guiding them and helping them to understand what they need to complete the objectives.

If both you and your pair have completed the same objectives, sync up by comparing your code and sharing what you learned.

### 3. Build together

Once you've synced up, you're ready to build together. With your pair, attempt to solve the next objectives in the challenge.

Get as far as you can in the time allotted, and don't worry about completing the _entire_ challenge. It is designed to be _challenging_, after all.

At the end of this stage, follow the instructions in the challenge to **submit your code**.

### 4. Log feedback

After practice time is over, stop working on the challenge and take a few minutes to log feedback for your pair.

Each pair should log feedback on their own computer using the [feedback log](#feedback-log).

The logged feedback is **confidential and anonymous**—the feedback you give them will be anonymized and bundled up with other feedback after you submit it.

### 5. Share feedback

After you log feedback in the computer, share some highlights with your pair verbally.

When sharing feedback with your pair, make sure to give good feedback.

### 6. Wrap up

Congrats! You've finished a pair learning session. Hopefully you learned something, and are better equipped to tackle the challenge.

Thank your pair for working with you, shake hands or give them a high five (whichever you prefer), and move on to your next session!

## Final Attempt

Welcome to the final stage! Like the first stage, the **Final Attempt** is a solo session (i.e. you work on your own). There are four steps:

1. Restart the challenge (create a new, empty gist and start over from the first objective)
1. Complete as much as you can using your newfound skills
1. Submit your challenge attempt
1. Reflect on your learning

This stage is meant to give you a clear sense of how much you've learned over the course of the Enrollment Game. Is the challenge easier than when you first attempted it? Are you able to get through more objectives more quickly?

After working on the challenge, submit your attempt (see the challenge for instructions) and reflect on your own learning by [logging feedback](#feedback-log).

## Fin

That's it! You've completed the Enrollment Game!

Time to celebrate. Give yourself a high five. Do a little dance. Run a victory lap. Whatever. You decide.

## Frequently Asked Questions

#### How do I "build together"?

If you've never worked on a coding problem with another person before, it can be a little awkward. That's ok! There's no one, right way to pair.

That being said, here are some useful techniques that you can use to make pairing fun and effective:

- Talk through the _procedure_ and _logic_ of your program with your pair before writing code.
- Work separately for 5 minutes, then share and compare for 2 minutes.
- Divide and conquer: split up the problem, each work on separate parts, and then share your solutions.

Regardless of which techniques you use, at the very least you should rely on your pair for help and ask them for help when you get stuck. Be generous with your knowledge!

#### What is good feedback?

It is important to be kind and respectful when giving feedback. Here is a good formula to use when giving feedback:

- Share one thing they did well
- Share one thing they can improve on
- Offer a suggestion for how they can improve

It is also important to give feedback on _behavior_, not _character_. Saying "What you did well is that you were nice." is not as useful/actionable as "One thing you did well was ask clarifying questions when you didn't fully understand what I said."
