# Learnathon

Welcome to the Learners Guild Learnathon!

This is a game to practice collective learning through a series of pair programming sessions on a set challenge.

## Preparing to Play

Before you can start playing, you'll need two things:

- A GitHub account (sign up at https://github.com/join)
- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (go through the [Pre-Game Tutorials](#pre-game-tutorials))

## How to Play

The game consists of many [pairing sessions](#the-pairing-session). To play the game, work with your pair to learn as much as you can using the challenge provided.

At the end of each pairing session, pairs give feedback to each other on a set of [essential skills](./skills.md).

Your goal is to integrate the feedback you receive and improve your scores over the course of your pairing sessions! The more you are able to improve, the better your overall score.

You need these materials:

1. A **pair** (another player to work with)
1. A **feedback log** (place to record feedback)
1. A **challenge** (coding problem to work on together)

Your facilitator will help you find a **pair** and provide you with a link to the **feedback log**.

Find the **challenge** in [this gist][challenge-gist]. Make sure to read the instructions thoroughly.

Once you have these materials, you are ready to start your first pairing session. After you complete a pairing session, choose another pair and start again! (The game is _recursive_ ;).

## Rules

This is a _collaborative_ game, not a competitive game. You will do better if you focus on giving, receiving, and integrating good feedback.

If you follow these rules, you will do well in the game. If you break these rules, you will be kicked out of the game.

1. Be honest. A good learning environment requires truth.
1. Be kind and respectful. Learning is a vulnerable act, so go easy on yourself and others.
1. Be willing to play. Follow curiosity with your pair.

OK, so we won't kick you out for not being playful. But you'll definitely have a lot more fun.

## The Pairing Session

A pairing session is two people working on the same problem together. You can think of it like group problem solving.

Stages of a pairing session:

### 1. Check-in

As soon as you sit down with your pair, start with a check-in.

Say hi to your pair! Introduce yourself, and share whatever you want to share with them that will help you be present and ready to work together.

Give them time to do the same.

### 2. Set working parameters

The next step is to determine some basic parameters for pairing together.

With your pair, decide:

- Who will be driving (using the keyboard), and who will be navigating (helping the driver)?
- Which skills are you aiming to improve? What would you like them to help you with?
- When do you want to switch drivers/navigators? (some pairs switch half-way, others bounce back and forth as needed)
- What tools do you want to use?

### 3. Practice the challenge

Once you've set up the working parameters with your pair, you're ready to begin working on the challenge.

Open the challenge and follow the instructions.

Get as far as you can in the time allotted, and don't worry about completing the _entire_ challenge. It is designed to be _challenging_, after all.

### 4. Log feedback

After practice time is over, stop working on the challenge and take a few minutes to log feedback and submit your code. Follow the instructions in the challenge for how to submit your code.

Each pair should log feedback on their own computer.

First, log feedback for _yourself_. Consider how you fared during that session, and submit a feedback log.

Second, log feedback for _your pair_. Consider their performance, and pay special attention to any skills that they specifically mentioned they wanted to improve.

The pair feedback is confidential - the feedback you give them will be anonymized and bundled up with other feedback after you submit it.

**However**, it is highly recommended that you ask your pair to share some or all of their feedback for you verbally, especially on the skills you want to improve.

_If you don't ask for verbal feedback from your pair, you will not know your feedback scores until after the game is over._

### 5. Wrap up

Thank your pair for working with you, shake hands or give them a high five, and move on to your next pairing session!
