# Instructions for Facilitators

As a Facilitator for the Learnathon, your primary job is to ensure that all Players have the necessary materials and structure to participate fully.

For more background information about the game, read the [Enrollment Game Design document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10_ZUYvicCy8nMCRwJG_FaR0EwRQbBKZdTw9u2CaeA_0/edit#).

## Setting Up a Game

Materials needed:

- Computers for every player (preferably laptops)
- A good internet connection for everyone
- The [Learnathon instructions and rules](README.md)
- A pairing schedule (see [this sample for an example](sample-pairing-schedule.md))
- A Feedback Log (see [this example][feedback-form])

To prepare for the game, make sure the following tasks are completed:

#### Prepare the Feedback Log

The Feedback Log includes a drop-down menu for Players' GitHub usernames.

You'll need to pre-populate this list using the Players' information, so make sure that all Players provide their GitHub username when registering for the game.

#### Create a Pairing Schedule

In a 4-hour game, there is time for 5 40-minute pairing sessions.

You'll need to come up with the pairing schedule ahead of time. The only criteria is to ensure that every Player pairs with as many other Players as possible. In other words, try to ensure that the same pair doesn't occur twice.
