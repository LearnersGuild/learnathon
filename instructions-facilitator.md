# Instructions for Facilitators

As a Facilitator for the Learnathon, your primary job is to ensure that all Players have the necessary materials and structure to participate fully.

Your accountabilities are to:

- Set up a game
- Run a game, including:
  - Orienting the players
  - Keeping schedule on track
  - Running coding & pairing sessions
  - Leading a wrap-up
- Perform post-game tasks

This document will help you set up for a game, run it, and do post-game tasks.

You should be familiar with the full structure of the game to best understand these instructions. At the very least, you should read:

- The [README](./README.md)
- The [Round 1 challenge](./challenge)
- The list of [Essential Skills](./README.md#essential-skills)
- The list of [materials](./materials.md) for the session

For more background information about the game, read the [Enrollment Game Design document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10_ZUYvicCy8nMCRwJG_FaR0EwRQbBKZdTw9u2CaeA_0/edit#).

## Setting Up a Game

To prepare for the game, make sure the following tasks are completed:

#### Get the Materials

- Computers for every player (preferably laptops)
- A good internet connection for everyone
- The [Learnathon instructions and rules](./README.md)
- A pairing schedule (see [this sample for an example](sample-pairing-schedule.md))
- A Feedback Log (see [this example][feedback-form]) with pre-loaded Player info

#### Prepare the Feedback Log

Create a new Feedback Log from [the template][feedback-form] to use for this specific Round.

The Feedback Log includes a drop-down menu for Players' GitHub usernames.

You'll need to pre-populate this list using the Players' information, so make sure that all Players provide their GitHub username when registering for the game.

Players will need access to this feedback log, so if you want to mail it to them or make a short URL (using bit.ly, for example) for easy sharing, go ahead.

#### Create a Pairing Schedule

In a 4-hour game, there is time for 5 40-minute pairing sessions.

You'll need to come up with the pairing schedule ahead of time. The only criteria is to ensure that every Player pairs with as many other Players as possible. In other words, try to ensure that the same pair doesn't occur twice.

## Running a Game

Once the game has started, your focus shifts to ensuring that Players are able to play well.

#### Orient the Players

First, you need to orient the Players and explain the game to them. Before they begin pairing, you should explain to them:

- The schedule for the day
- The goals of the Learnathon - how to win
- How to ask for help

All of this information is available in the [README](./README.md) for Players to reference, but it is important for you to repeat it.

#### Run First Challenge Attempt

The first thing Players do is to make a solo attempt at the challenge.

Make sure each player has a laptop, a link to the challenge, and a link to the feedback form.

Make sure that all Players are well informed of the timeline.

#### Orient for Pairing

Before running pairing sessions, you need to orient the Players to feedback and to how pairing will work.

Share with them:

- How pairing works
- Whom they are pairing with
- How feedback works (share link to Feedback Log)
- What good feedback looks like

#### Run Pairing Sessions

You are responsible for being timekeeper and setting the pace of pairing sessions.

This means:

- Letting all Players know when a session starts
- Letting all Players know when they need to switch pairs
- Giving them a 5-minute warning before they need to switch to logging feedback
- Telling all Players to stop working on the challenge and start logging feedback
- Encouraging all Players to ask for verbal feedback from their pair (and reminding them to [give good feedback](./README.md#giving-good-feedback))
- Giving Players time to switch pairs before the next session

Here is a suggested 45-minute agenda for a pairing session:

- Min 0: Start pairing session with theme prompt ("The pairing session has started! Check in with your pair. For this session, focus on <session theme>")
- Min 25: 5-minute warning for feedback ("Feedback starts in 5 minutes, wrap up your practice.")
- Min 30: Feedback time ("Time to give feedback! Stop working on the challenge, and log feedback using the feedback form.")
- Min 35: 5-minute warning; verbal feedback reminder ("5 minutes until next session. Now's the time to get verbal feedback from your pair.")
- Min 40: Have players find their next pair ("Everybody find the your next pair.")
- Min 45: Start next session.

##### Session Themes

Before each session, you can choose to set a "theme" to direct Players' focus and attention.

Use your best judgment to pick a theme that works best given the context of the room. For example, if you notice that lots of pairs are not talking to each other much, add a theme of "only use one computer" so that they are forced to work more closely together.

Here is a suggested progression of themes:

1. Focus on communication: pairs optimize for both members fully comprehending their solution over "just getting it to work".
1. Focus on decomposition: break the problem into as many small pieces as possible.
1. Focus on procedure: optimize the logic behind any solution before writing any code.
1. Focus on collaboration: pairs optimize for equal contribution.
1. Focus on persistence: get through as many objectives as possible.

#### Run Final Challenge Attempt

The last thing Players do is to make a final solo attempt at the challenge.

Make sure that all Players are well informed of the timeline.

#### Wrap Up

At the end of the day, bring all the Players back together to:

- Inform them of next steps and necessary tasks
  - Alert them to exit survey, they need to complete this survey in order to be eligible for Round 2
  - Explain Round 2
- Open the floor for Players to share:
  - Shout-outs to other Players for great mentorship
  - Insights and "aha" moments
- Congratulate them on completing Round 1
  - Make this exciting, festive - want to end on a high note

## Post-Game

After the game is over, Players need to be evaluated to determine whom will be invited to Round 2.

#### Send the Exit Survey

Each Player should be emailed a copy of the [Exit Survey](TODO: add link).

In order to be eligible for Round 2 selection, a Player has to complete the Exit Survey.
