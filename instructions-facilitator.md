# Instructions for Facilitators

As a Facilitator for the Learnathon, your primary job is to ensure that all Players have the necessary materials and structure to participate fully.

This document will help you set up for a game, run it, and do post-game tasks.

For more background information about the game, read the [Enrollment Game Design document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10_ZUYvicCy8nMCRwJG_FaR0EwRQbBKZdTw9u2CaeA_0/edit#).

## Setting Up a Game

To prepare for the game, make sure the following tasks are completed:

#### Get the Materials

- Computers for every player (preferably laptops)
- A good internet connection for everyone
- The [Learnathon instructions and rules](README.md)
- A pairing schedule (see [this sample for an example](sample-pairing-schedule.md))
- A Feedback Log (see [this example][feedback-form])

#### Prepare the Feedback Log

The Feedback Log includes a drop-down menu for Players' GitHub usernames.

You'll need to pre-populate this list using the Players' information, so make sure that all Players provide their GitHub username when registering for the game.

#### Create a Pairing Schedule

In a 4-hour game, there is time for 5 40-minute pairing sessions.

You'll need to come up with the pairing schedule ahead of time. The only criteria is to ensure that every Player pairs with as many other Players as possible. In other words, try to ensure that the same pair doesn't occur twice.

## Running a Game

Once the game has started, your focus shifts to ensuring that Players are able to play well.

#### Orient the Players

First, you need to orient the Players and explain the game to them. Before they begin pairing, you should explain to them:

- The schedule for the day
- How pairing works
- Who they are pairing with
- How feedback works
- What good feedback looks like
- How to ask for help

All of this information is available in the [README](./README.md) for Players to reference, but it is important for you to repeat it.

#### Run Pairing Sessions

You are responsible for being timekeeper and setting the pace of pairing sessions.

This means:

- Letting all Players know when a session starts
- Giving them a 5-minute warning before they need to switch to logging feedback
- Telling all Players to stop working on the challenge and start logging feedback
- Encouraging all Players to ask for verbal feedback from their pair
- Giving Players time to switch pairs before the next session

#### Wrap Up

At the end of the day, bring all the Players back together to:

- Inform them of next steps and necessary tasks
  - Alert them to exit survey, they need to complete this survey in order to be eligible for Round 2
  - Explain Round 2
- Open the floor for Players to share:
  - Shout-outs to other Players for great mentorship
  - Insights and "aha" moments
- Congratulate them on completing Round 1
  - Make this exciting, festive - want to end on a high note

## Post-Game

After the game is over, Players need to be evaluated to determine whom will be invited to Round 2.

#### Send the Exit Survey

Each Player should be emailed a copy of the [Exit Survey](TODO: add link).

In order to be eligible for Round 2 selection, a Player has to complete the Exit Survey.
