# Instructions for Evaluators

As an Evaluator for the Learnathon, your job is to review, evaluate, and score Players. You will log your findings into the appropriate system.

Your accountabilities are to:

- Analyze Player data
- Evaluate challenge submissions
- Submit [Player scorecards][scorecard]

This document will help you understand how to fulfill your accountabilities well.

You should be familiar with the full structure of the game to best understand these instructions. At the very least, you should read:

- The [README](./README.md)
- The Round 1 challenge (find link in [README](./README.md))
- The list of [Essential Skills](./README.md#essential-skills)

For more background information about the game, read the [Enrollment Game Design document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10_ZUYvicCy8nMCRwJG_FaR0EwRQbBKZdTw9u2CaeA_0/edit#).

## Analyzing Player Data

For each Player you evaluate, you should start by analyzing the game data already stored about the Player.

Using the data provided in HubSpot, collect the stats needed for scoring (see [scoring instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10_ZUYvicCy8nMCRwJG_FaR0EwRQbBKZdTw9u2CaeA_0/edit#heading=h.uxtttrv1j64f)).

The Challenge Improvement score will not be available, because you haven't evaluated their challenge submission yet.

## Evaluating Challenge Submissions

To determine the Challenge Improvement score, you will need access to the Player's initial and final challenge submission (in the form of GitHub gists).

Use the [challenge improvement rubric][challenge-improvement-rubric] to score the Player.

## Submitting Player Scorecards

Once you've gathered the appropriate data and evaluated a Player's challenge submission, you must submit a [Player Scorecard][scorecard].

Do this once per Player per round. Make sure to include your email on this form so that you get credit for the evaluation.
