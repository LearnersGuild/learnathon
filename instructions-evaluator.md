# Instructions for Evaluators

As an Evaluator for the Learnathon, your job is to review, evaluate, and score Players. You will log your findings into the appropriate system.

Your accountabilities are to:

- Analyze Player data
- Evaluate challenge submissions
- Submit [Player scorecards][scorecard]

This document will help you understand how to fulfill your accountabilities well.

You should be familiar with the full structure of the Learnathon to best understand these instructions. At the very least, you should read:

- The [README](./README.md)
- The [challenge](./challenge)
- The list of [Essential Skills](./README.md#essential-skills)

For more background information about the Learnathon, read the [Enrollment Game Design document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10_ZUYvicCy8nMCRwJG_FaR0EwRQbBKZdTw9u2CaeA_0/edit#).

## Analyzing Player Data

For each Player you evaluate, you should start by analyzing the data already stored about the Player.

Using the data provided in HubSpot, collect the stats needed for scoring (see [scoring instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10_ZUYvicCy8nMCRwJG_FaR0EwRQbBKZdTw9u2CaeA_0/edit#heading=h.uxtttrv1j64f)).

The Challenge Improvement score will not be available, because you haven't evaluated their challenge submission yet.

## Evaluating Challenge Submissions

To determine the Challenge Improvement score, you will need access to the Player's initial and final challenge submission (in the form of GitHub gists).

Use any of the example challenge solutions to compare code against if you need a sense of what a _good_ solution looks like:

- [Example Solution to Objective 1](./solutions/obj-1/)
- [Example Solution to Objective 2](./solutions/obj-2/)
- [Example Solution to Objective 3](./solutions/obj-3/)
- [Example Solution to Objective 4](./solutions/obj-4/)
- [Example Solution to Objective 5](./solutions/obj-5/)

## Submitting Player Scorecards

Once you've gathered the appropriate data and evaluated a Player's challenge submission, you must submit a [Player Scorecard][scorecard].

Do this **for every applicant who confirmed for enrollment game, even those who were no-shows.** Make sure to include your email on this form so that you get credit for the evaluation.
