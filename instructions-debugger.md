# Instructions for Debuggers

As a Debugger for the Learnathon, your primary job is to ensure that all Players  don't spend too much time in "stuck" zone. You are there to help them "debug" both technical and non-technical difficulties they may encounter.

Your accountabilities are to:

- Respond to Player help requests
- Answer Player questions
- Clarify game rules for Players

This document will help you understand how to fulfill your accountabilities well.

You should be familiar with the full structure of the game to best understand these instructions. At the very least, you should read:

- The [README](./README.md)
- The Round 1 challenge (find link in [README](./README.md))
- The list of [Essential Skills](./README.md#essential-skills)

For more background information about the game, read the [Enrollment Game Design document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10_ZUYvicCy8nMCRwJG_FaR0EwRQbBKZdTw9u2CaeA_0/edit#).

## Responding to Help Requests

You need to be available to Players. They should not have to wait long or look far to get help from you.

To do this, it is helpful to:

- Walk around the room, sit somewhere in plain view of all pairs, or otherwise make yourself visible
- Instruct the Players in how to request help (e.g. hold up a hand, come over and tap you on the shoulder...)

## Answering Questions

Once you get to a Player or pair who have requested help, you need to focus on getting them un-stuck as fast as possible so that you can respond to any other pairs.

To do this, it is helpful to:

- Require a well-formulated question
  - If they don't, ask them to do some preliminary research and come back with a more specific, clear question.
  - For example, responding to a question like "Why doesn't my code work?" can be answered with "Google the error, try to identify the bug, and then come get me if you still can't solve it."
- Route to online resources rather than using verbal explanations
  - Whenever possible, send Players to a useful online resource where they can learn more about their question. They can call you back to clarify something they find, but your time is better spent directing Players to answers, not explaining things to them.
- Engage both Players in a pair
  - Often questions asked by one Player in a pair will not be intelligible to the other Player. Make sure that both Players are clear on what their question is before attempting to resolve.

## Clarifying Game Rules

When Players have questions about the rules of the game, answer them as clearly and succinctly as you can. You can also direct them to the [README](./README.md) for more information.

If you are unsure of how to answer, pull in the Facilitator to clarify.
